Client side routing, with the help of the **React Router** library, is the industry
standard for creating a multi-page UX in a single page application (from the servers perspective).

- it covers all functionalities that are mostly needed
- it has many tools that make routing straightforward(ish)

> It has gone through many major version changes and some of the older ones
> are still used in production. The APIs for the major wersions are not always
> compatible with each other, which is important to keep in mind - good to be up to date
> on the available features in the release notes.
